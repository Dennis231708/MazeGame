# MazeGame
A maze game that uses an algorithm to auto generate a unique maze on every page load.
This project helped me cement some of the core vanilla javascript concepts and really showed me how you can create anything with javascript.
Something I would want to implement into the future is a popup/menu on the pages initial load that allows the player to select the difficulty of the maze at the
click of a button. The difficulty would be selected and then it would change the dimensions of the grid used to create the maze. 


This project is currently hosted on Netlify if you would like to play the game the link is below.
