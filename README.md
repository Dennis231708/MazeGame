# MazeGame
A maze game that uses an algorithm to auto generate a unique maze on every page load.
This project helped me cement some of the core vanilla javascript concepts and really showed me how you can create anything with javascript.
Something I would want to implement into the future is a popup/menu on the pages initial load that allows the player to select the difficulty of the maze at the
click of a button. The difficulty would be selected and then it would change the dimensions of the grid used to create the maze.
